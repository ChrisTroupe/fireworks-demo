## Required Questions
### Question 1
How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
I used the prompt as much as I could to get an idea for what to do. For example, I used the basic setup of the header, content, and then footer that was provided. I didn't stray too far from the provided website images. Since it was a relatively simple website, I decided to not dig too far into react-router-dom. Due to the time consuming nature as well as the test prompt, I decided to not implement any of the functionality of contact, home, etc. I used tachyons to simplify some CSS coding and tried to implement componenets as clearly as possible. 

### Question 2
Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
Yes! I could make many improvements to my submission including code readability, optimization, testing, and adding functionality. 

### Question 3
What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

If I were allotted more time I would learn more about the react-router-dom for linking different pages. I would clean up all of the code making it more readable and adding more comments as neccesary. I would also optimize the website more for mobile phones. Additionally, I would add all of the additional pages like contact/about/etc. Also, I was a little brazen with my color scheme so I may tone it down a little as well. Finally, I like challenging myself and I think it would have been fun to add functionality to be able to actually play the video. 



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
